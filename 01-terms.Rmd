Claim level data elements. These are also referred to as header level data elements.

**Patient identifier**


How do we classify a claim? It is helpful to be able to put a claim into one of a number of categories. 

Professional vs. Facility
Inpaitient vs. Outpatient

Where did the care happen? Who provided the care? What care was delivered? What was the primary reason for the care?

We would like nice clean answers to these questions gleaned from information on the claim.
